"""Analyze the provided image result /n {{result}} /n and output a JSON response detailing the object's size, shape, color, surrounding environment, and the optimal cutting position for cropping by a robotic arm.
According to example create json format, and output only json without any words. And "image_processing_by_gpt4v" is necessary key, others are whatever you want.そしてkeyは英語で、内容は日本語で答えてください。

example：
{
  "image_processing_by_gpt4v": {
    "size": "15cm x 10cm x 8cm",
    "shape": "Rectangular prism",
    "color": "Blue with white stripes",
    "surrounding_environment": "Located on a wooden table, near a window with natural light",
    "cutting_point_rule": "Located on a wooden table, near a window with natural light",
    "robotic_arm_cutting_position": {
      "x_coordinate": 7.5,
      "y_coordinate": 5,
      "z_coordinate": 4,
      "orientation": "Horizontal grasp from the top"
    },
    "Reasons of grasping position": "It's thin and it's the position of upper than grapes. Based on your rule, that's the position of cutting. ",
  }
}
