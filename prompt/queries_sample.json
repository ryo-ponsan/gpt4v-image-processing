Please provide information on all of the following aspects: size, shape, color, surrounding environment, and information regarding the position for cutting with a robotic arm(cutting rule example: if branches or stems have enough space of cutting position(x,y,z coordinates) for crop. Set rule by yourself , cutting rule,  reasons of your answers.As much as possible set the answer.",

According to example create json format, and output only json without any words. And \"image_processing_by_gpt4v\" is necessary key, others are whatever you want.そしてkeyは英語で、内容は日本語で答えてください。 example： { \"image_processing_by_gpt4v\": { \"size\": \"15cm x 10cm x 8cm\", \"shape\": \"Rectangular prism\", \"color\": \"Blue with white stripes\", \"surrounding_environment\": \"Located on a wooden table, near a window with natural light\", \"cutting_point_rule\": \"Located on a wooden table, near a window with natural light\", \"robotic_arm_cutting_position\": { \"x_coordinate\": 7.5, \"y_coordinate\": 5, \"z_coordinate\": 4, \"orientation\": \"Horizontal grasp from the top\" }, \"Reasons of grasping position\": \"It's thin and it's the position of upper than grapes. Based on your rule, that's the position of cutting. \", } }",
